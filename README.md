# Interview_task01
This project is one challenge that I made in a Interview in a German Company 2018 using Java Spring Framework 5, Hibernate, JPA, H2. 

I created an application to make the schedule of activities during the day. 
I read the initial information in one file when the program starts and 
I generate the result of the schedules when the program has finished.

I made this, to demostrate my knowledges in that technology (2018).

You can see a little the specifications in this direction:
